# multi-threaded-encryptor

🔐 C++ File Encryptor & Decryptor
A fast and efficient file encryption & decryption tool written in C++. This program encrypts or decrypts files in a directory using a simple key-based algorithm. Future updates will include multithreading for even faster performance! ⚡

---

**📌 Features**

✅ Encrypt & decrypt any file 📂

✅ Process entire directories recursively 📁➡️📄

✅ Uses an encryption key stored in an .env file 🔑

✅ Task queue system for managing files efficiently 🚀

✅ Built with modern C++ (C++17 or later)
